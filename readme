### Google OAuth Client Setup
To enable Google OAuth authentication, you'll need to set up a Google OAuth client. Follow these steps:
1. Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create a new project and enable the Google+ API.
3. Create credentials for your project (OAuth client ID).
4. Configure the authorized redirect URIs for your application, including the callback URL.

For detailed instructions on setting up a Google OAuth client, refer to the [Google OAuth 2.0 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).
